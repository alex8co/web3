Excellent question. Yes, you absolutely can install Foundry that way.

This is a great workaround for your proxy issue because it avoids the installer script (`foundryup`) and lets you download the compiled program files directly.

This process is a manual installation. You are essentially downloading the final executables (`forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, etc.) and putting them somewhere your system can find them.

Here is the step-by-step guide to do it correctly.

### Step-by-Step Manual Installation

**1. Download the File**

You can use `wget` or `curl` to download the file. Since `curl` was giving you proxy issues, `wget` might work, or you can simply download it using your web browser from the link you provided.

*   **Option A (Command Line with `wget`)**
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/download/nightly-9399689feca0fe7e6b612f8533926cafebc6e597/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    ```

*   **Option B (Command Line with `curl`)**
    This might fail with the same proxy error, but the command would be:
    ```bash
    curl -L -O https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/download/nightly-9399689feca0fe7e6b612f8533926cafebc6e597/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    ```
    *(The `-O` flag saves the output to a file with the same name as the remote file.)*

**2. Extract the Archive**

The downloaded file is a compressed archive (`.tar.gz`). You need to extract its contents. This command will create a `bin` directory in your current location containing the Foundry executables.

```bash
tar -xzvf foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
After running this, you will have a new directory named `bin`. If you check its contents (`ls bin`), you will see `anvil`, `cast`, `chisel`, and `forge`.

**3. Move the Binaries to a Standard Location**

The official Foundry installer places the binaries in `~/.foundry/bin`. It's a good practice to follow this convention.

```bash
# Create the directory if it doesn't exist (-p prevents errors)
mkdir -p ~/.foundry/bin

# Move the extracted programs into that directory
mv bin/* ~/.foundry/bin/
```

**4. Add the Foundry Binaries to Your System's PATH**

Your shell needs to know where to look for the `forge`, `cast`, etc. commands. You do this by adding the `~/.foundry/bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

1.  **Identify your shell configuration file.**
    *   If you use Bash, it's `~/.bashrc`.
    *   If you use Zsh (common on macOS and many Linux distros), it's `~/.zshrc`.

2.  **Add the export command to the end of that file.**
    ```bash
    # For Bash
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

    # For Zsh
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
    *This command adds the line `export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"` to the end of your config file.*

**5. Apply the Changes and Verify**

For the changes to take effect, you must either **open a new terminal window** or "source" your configuration file in the current terminal.

```bash
# If you use Bash
source ~/.bashrc

# If you use Zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, verify the installation by checking the version of one of the tools:

```bash
forge --version
```

If it prints a version number (e.g., `forge 0.2.0 (...)`), your installation was successful!

### Important: The Downside of This Method

While this method gets you up and running, it has one major drawback:

*   **No Automatic Updates:** The standard installer sets up a tool called `foundryup`. This tool allows you to easily update Foundry to the latest version (`foundryup`), switch between nightly and stable versions, or revert to an older version.

By installing manually, **you will not have `foundryup`**. You are "pinned" to the specific nightly version you downloaded. To update, you would have to repeat the entire manual download and copy process.

**Recommendation:**
This manual installation is an **excellent workaround** for your current proxy problem. Once you are on a network without this issue (or you fix your proxy settings), I recommend running the official installer (`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`) to get the full `foundryup` management tool.
